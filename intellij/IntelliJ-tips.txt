Navigation through files
========================

<Control> + n : Find a CLASS 	--> Camel case completion
								--> * wildcard
								--> Go to line 40 of class MapperTest = MapperTest:40
<Control> + <Shift> + n : 	Find a FILE
							Find a FOLDER
							wildcards

<Control> + <Alt> + <Shift> + n : Look for a SYMBOL (across entire codebase) (variables, 
									methods, ...)
								Namespace filtering:
								--> use Classname.symbolName when you know in which 
									class it is
								--> Camel case completion for classname is available
																				
<Shift> + <Shift> : Search anywhere, for anything (search for a Type, 
					search for a File, ...)
						--> Camel case completion, ... is available
						--> Once you start typing, the dropdown that will be shown, 
							contains different sections which you can reach with <TAB> key
						--> shows us recent files by default
								this is a good alternative for tabs
						--> not only looks for classes, but also for files, actions in 
							the menu items, run configurations, ... 
							
							ex. 'nav' --> switch on/off the navigation bar
							ex. 'toolbar' --> switch on/off the main toolbar
							ex. 'annotate' --> switch on/off the annotations (git)
							ex. type in the run/debug configuration you want to start
									--> to select a run configuration, you can switch 
									between a debug and a run config by using 
									the <Shift> button	
							ex. 'Test restfull' --> opens a tool to test a rest api
						--> use < and > arrow to get previous and next search you used 
							before (history)
						

<Control> + <Shift> + a : Find an action (popup menu)
<Control> + <Shift> + f : Find in path (Menu Edit / Find / Find in Path)

<Alt> + 9 : Version control
	--> local changes tab: shows any changes you have made to the project
	--> Shelf tab: tracks changes that you want to save for later
	--> Log tab: list of changes that you have in your LOCAL repository (here you find where HEAD and master are located)

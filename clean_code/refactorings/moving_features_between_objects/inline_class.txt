Problem:
    A class does almost nothing and isnâ€™t responsible for anything, and no additional responsibilities are
    planned for it.

Solution:
    Move all features from the class to another one.

Why/Benefits:
    No needless classes that need to be loaded

How to refactor:
    1. In the recipient class, create the public fields and methods present in the donor class.
    Methods should refer to the equivalent methods of the donor class.

    2. Replace all references to the donor class with references to the fields and methods of the recipient class.

    3. Now test the program and make sure that no errors have been added. If tests show that everything is working OK,
    start using 'Move Method' and 'Move Field' to completely transplant all functionality to the recipient class from
    the original one. Continue doing so until the original class is completely empty.

    4. Delete the original class.

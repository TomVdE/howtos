Layout
------

Readable, good indentation

Naming of variables
-------------------

clear, pronounceable, use nouns

Naming of methods
-----------------

use verbs, be consistent (use always 'get' and don't mix 'get' and 'fetch')

Vocabulary
----------

ubiquitous language

Functions/methods
-----------------

as short as possible
1 function, 1 task -> no side effects
don't nest to deep control structures like if-else, loops, ...
the less method arguments, the better
    more than 3 is problematic
        ex. Circle makeCircle(double x, double y, double radius) --> Circle makeCircle(Point center, double radius)
avoid output arguments --> increases unreadability of your code
if returning a result is not enough, it is an indication that your function does to much
error handling
    throwing exceptions = good
    returning different status codes = bad --> results in if conditions

Comments
--------

if you see bad code, refactor it instead of putting a comment in it
never leave code commented out, instead use version control functionality
avoid noise comments (= unneccessary comments)

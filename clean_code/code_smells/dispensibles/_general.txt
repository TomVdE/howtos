A dispensable is something pointless and unneeded whose absence would make the code cleaner, more efficient and
easier to understand.

Dead code
---------
A variable, parameter, field, method or class is no longer used (usually because itâ€™s obsolete).

Speculative generality
----------------------
Unneeded 'what if's' are handled in the code, resulting in unused classes, methods, fields, parameters, if-else
cases, ...

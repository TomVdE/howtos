A variable, parameter, field, method or class is no longer used (usually because itâ€™s obsolete).

Reasons
-------

Requirements changed, corrections have been made, nobody had time to clean up old code
Can also be found in complex code blocks, when one of the branches becomes unreachable

Treatments
----------

- Use good IDE to find dead code
- In case of unnecessary class --> Inline class
- In case of unnecessary sub- or superclass --> Collapse Hierarchy
- To remove unneeded parameters --> Remove parameter

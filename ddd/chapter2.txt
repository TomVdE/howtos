Distilling the problem domain
=============================

Knowledge crunching and collaboration
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

Knowledge crunching = the art of distilling relevant information from the problem domain in order to build a
    useful model that can fulfill the needs of business use cases

Collaboration (between tech team and domain experts) is needed to get a deep insight of the problem domain

Use whiteboards, work through examples with business experts and brainstorm together.
As a starting point, use Business Use Cases

    Ubiquitous Language
    -------------------
        This language   should be made explicit
                        should be used when describing the domain model and problem domain
                        should be used in the code implementation of the model (terms and concepts used as class names,
                                                                                    properties, method names, ...)
    Domain knowledge
    ----------------
        The more you own domain knowledge, the better you are able to create a model at the heart of the application's
        code base that can fulfill the business use cases

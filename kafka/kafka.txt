Topics
======
A particular stream of data
    you can have as many topics as you want
    a topic is identified by its name

Partitions and offsets
======================
Topics are split in partition
    each partition is ordered, no ordering across partitions
    each message within a partition gets an incremental id, called OFFSET
        --> offsets only have a meaning for a specific partition
                e.g. offset 3 in partition 0 doesn't represent the same data as offset 3 in partion 1

A message is identified as: Kafka Topic - Partition ... - Offset ...

Data is kept only for a limited time (default is one week), after that, the data is gone

Once data is written to a partition, it can't be changed = IMMUTABILITY

Data is assigned randomly to a partition unless a key is provided

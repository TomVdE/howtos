Ignoring files
==============

To avoid that files become available for tracking = git sees them as 
untracked files, use my_project/.gitignore (provide git with a set of rules
that it can use to know which files to ignore

	- list of files, one line for each file
	- very basic regular expressions
		? [characters] [0-9]
	- negate expressions (=not ignore this)
	- ignore all files in a directory with a trailing slash
	- comments begin with #
	- blank lines are skipped
	
	ex.:	*.php
			!index.php (=not ignore this one)
			assets/videos/
	
Globally ignore files:
	- ignored in all repositories
	- settings not tracked in repository
	- user-specific instead of repository-specific (mac user <--> windows user)
	
Ideas on what to ignore
-----------------------

- compiled source code
- packages and compressed files (disk images, *.gz, *.zip, *.7z, ...)
- logs and databases
- operating system generated files
- user uploaded assets (images, PDF"s, videos)
